What's the point of a survival modpack if you don't have the tools to defend yourself? Minecraft 
White comes with a large selection of tech mods to help you stay on top of the world. While you 
won't find any mods that give you an easy start here, what you will get is a rock-solid set of tools
that are well worth your time and effort. Whether you decide to follow the path of a Buildcraft 
engineer, a Thaumaturge, or a humble beekeeper, you will quickly realize that keeping up with your 
technology is the only way to stay alive in this world.
