ExtraBiomes XL (link to https://github.com/ExtrabiomesXL/ExtrabiomesXL)	Coros' Weather Mod (link to http://www.coros.us/mods/tornadoes)	Natura (link to http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1753754-162natura/)

Packed with mods such as Biomes O' Plenty, MAtmos, and Presence Footsteps, this modpack starts with 
a plethora of mods that aim to deeply immerse you in your minecraft world. Enjoy exploring the 
breathtaking vistas, pass the time cultivating a verdant garden, or simply listen to the soothing 
sounds of a mountain waterfall. It's not all swarming hordes of zombies and skeletons after all, and
you have to take some time to appreciate the nature around you. At least until a tornado sweeps up 
your house.
