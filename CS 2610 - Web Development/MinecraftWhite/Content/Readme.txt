So, I went a little overboard with my homepage at first, 
and then decided to split it into smaller pages. Because
of this, I actually have four pages of content so far,
so for grading purposes you can ignore the atmosphere.htm
file. Basically,

Page 1 - Main Page: index.htm
Page 2 - Secondary Page: technology.htm
Page 3 - Secondary Page (Under Construction): construction.htm

Thanks!
